# Team Data Science Project Template

This template is an implementation of the Microsoft's Team Data Science Project Template that is currently used at the "Programa de Formaci√≥n en Machine Learning and Data Science" at Universidad Nacional de Colombia.

You'll need tools like `poetry` (default), `venv`, `pyenv` (default), `renv`, `conda`, among others for dependency management and resolution.

This template provides the following folders:

* `packagename`: put the source code (classes and functions) in this folder.
* `docs`: put the documentation in this folder.
* `scripts`: this folder must contain the scripts/notebooks that will be executed.
